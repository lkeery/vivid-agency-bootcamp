The official GitHub repository for Vivid Agency. 

**We don't follow design trends, we create them. Our vision always stays VIVID.**

## Our Branding

Our core values are:
* **Simplicity**
* **Consistency**
* **Quality**
* **Customer Oriented**
* **Sophisticated**
* **Bold and unapologetic**


We strive for these principles in every design. 

Our brand focouses on web developement and design, UX/UI design and creative production. Throughout all of our creatives, we aim to achieve an emotional connection with our audience. 

### Typography

Our typography is fundamental to our brand identity and expression. Within designs, our defined fonts should be used to help further create a simplistic and bold creation. 

Our primary fonts are ```Montserrat Alternates``` and ```Open Sans```. Montserrat Alternates should be used for headings, and Open Sans should be used for larger bodies of text.
